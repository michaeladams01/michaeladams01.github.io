This code creates a simple webpage with the title "Will You Be My Valentine?" and two buttons labeled "Yes" and "No".

If the "Yes" button is clicked, it displays a hidden message below the buttons, expressing gratitude and wishing a happy Valentine's Day. Additionally, it generates a visual effect of fireworks using CSS animations.
If the "No" button is clicked, it triggers an alert reminding the user to think again.
