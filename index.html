        <h1>Trends in the Data Analytics Industry</h1>
<p>Trends in the Data Analytics Industry change throughout the years. Data Analytics use cases in businesses, environment, social, and government fields remain relevant; Data Analytics and not instincts, drives most business decisions (Srinivasan 2021).  I have identified three trends in the Data Analytics industry that are extremely relevant and will have a lasting impact on the field. The top three trends in the Data Analytics Industry are as follows: Machine learning (ML)– a new trend in the data analytics industry that can automate the data analytics process and create new insights from by learning from past data. Democratization and data sharing - Data democratization is the ongoing process of enabling everybody in an organization, irrespective of their technical know-how, to work with data comfortably, to feel confident talking about it, and, as a result, make data-informed decisions and build customer experiences powered by data (Choudhury, 2022). Lastly, Data Fabric - an architecture and set of data services that provide consistent capabilities across a choice of endpoints spanning hybrid multi-cloud environments (Gupta 2021). These three trends in the Data Analytics industry will be the topic of discussion throughout the rest of this paper. </p>
<h2>Discussion of Three Trends </h2>
<h2>Machine Learning </h2>
<p>Machine learning is a new trend to the field of data analytics in terms of how it can automate data analytics process. According to IBM, Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and Computer Science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy (“What Is Machine Learning?” 2021,). In other words, machine learning can use data from the past to predict the future.  There are two main common types of Machine learning, supervised and unsupervised learning.  Performing data analysis with traditional tools can be inaccurate and time consuming. Especially with the vast amount of open-source data available to around the word and on the world wide web. For instance, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, millions of people conveniently express their views and opinions on social media platforms; data extracted from these platforms can be accessed and potentially be useful in guiding resource allocation (Reynard, & Shirgaokar, (2019). Machine learning can be useful in guiding resource allocation with the use of Naïve Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis, a machine learning algorithm that uses supervised learning to find out the location of the most impoverished population. Location-based social networks like Twitter can relay not just what is happening but where; Twitter is a valuable tool since a large volume of data can be collected quickly for little cost to the researcher. Researchers can analyze the sentiments in tweets to understand what Twitter users are saying about relevant topics (Reynard & Shirgaokar, 2019). People interacting and communicating over the web has made machine learning a trend in recent years because of how much data is available. The current rate of technological advancement will in turn affect the popularity of machine learning because its use cause is going to keep advancing. 
Another example where machine learning is relevant in the data analytics industry is in combat operations, with vast amounts of data becoming available to intelligence analysts, new tools will help them sift and interpret it all (Knight, 2022). One of the most promising uses of machine learning application for intelligence analyst is the use in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  In addition, Machine learning is extremely relevant in data analysis because machine learning algorithms are going to continue evolving in the coming decades as its use cases for intelligence analyst continue to grow.</p>
<h2>Data Fabric </h2>
<P>According to IBM A data fabric is an architectural approach to simplify data access in an organization to facilitate self-service data consumption, there are four main components of a data fabric; insights and semantics, unified governance and compliance, intelligent integration, orchestration, and lifecycle – automates data lifecycle by infusing Artificial Intelligence (AI). Data fabric can have many use cases, one of which can be found in the field of financial engineering. A Data Fabric is relevant in Financial Engineering because it can be used to find insights in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data for institutional investors. Intelligent investors can use a data fabric to guide their decision and mitigate risk factors.</P>

<h2>Democratization and Data Sharing </h2>
The democratization of data has been brewing as a trend and is becoming more prominent as institutions become more globalized. Data democratization as a trend in the data analytics industry is not only about making data more accessible, but to have access to tools to access data that can make gaining insights for data more accessible. For instance, as a service member, when leaders need to ask questions with data in mind, their subordinates accumulate and make sense of large amounts of data, analyze it, and then synthesize it—all to help their leaders make better decisions. However, the types of problems, and the data necessary to analyze those problems might not be fully understood by the peer or subordinate. This is where data democratization and literacy come in. In combat operations, leaders can be able to work with data and make better data driven decisions. There is no proven one-size-fits-all approach to building a data democracy, but empowering people is a crucial step in that direction (Choudhury, 2022). In other words, data democratization promotes collaboration across different disciplines. In contrast, as data becomes more widely available across different disciplines, an issue of data security begins to emerge. Data security becomes an issue when people exploit the data.  

<h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Strict Data Policy for Data Analytics</h2> 
<p>A prominent issue surrounding the field of data analysis is the issue of data security. Improper use of data by analysts and researcher scientists can lead to data exploitation. Most non-trivial Data Science applications are interdisciplinary requiring collaboration across disciplines (Brodie, n.d.) Data security is an emerging issue for analysts because it extends into other industries. One might argue that enacting strict policies prevent exploitation of the data while others might argue that limiting the use of data, restrictive policies will hinder progress. 
Data exploitation across disciplines
This issue of data theft and exploitation is prominent across disciplines. In the field of scientific research for instance; many countries share genetic data but some countries like China and other low-income countries are becoming more restrictive with data sharing and enacting strict policies on the usage of their genetic data due to data exploitation. China is expanding control over the use of genetic data from people in the country, including for scientific research…government officials say restriction on the use of genetic data are designed to increase protection of this resource. They were developed in response to companies exporting genetic data without permission, as well as other incident, including the explosive revelation by Chinese researcher He Jiankui that he had created the first babies with edited genomes in 2018 (Mallapaty, 2022). One might argue that enacting strict data sharing policies limits collaboration between researchers and scientists. This in turn limits the rate of discoveries and innovations. On the other hand, enacting strict data policies prevents incidents like the one where a Chinese researcher created genetic engineered babies with edited genomes. </p>


<h2>Is Machine Learning Secure</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence can have a positive impact on our daily live, from the use of assistants like Siri and Alexa, facial recognition to self-=driving cars. Every time we use a machine learning technology in our personal life, we leave a digital trail of data. This data can be trained on machine learning algorithms that can be used to make our lives easier. Serval threats in machine learning have been addressed by experts 1) Training data poisoning can result in a decrease in model accuracy or lead to other error-generic/error-specific attack purposes; 2) A well-designed backdoor in the training data can trigger dangerous consequences of a system; 3) A carefully-crafted disturbance in the test input (adversarial examples) can make the model go wrong; 4) Model stealing attack, model inversion attack and membership inference attack can steal the model parameters or recover the sensitive training data; all the above security threats can lead to serious consequences to machine learning systems, especially in security and safety critical applications, such as autonomous driving, smart security, smart healthcare, etc (Xue et al, 2020). Mitigating the threats associated with machine learning generally falls not only on developers but also on end users. One approach to the issue of machine learning security is to filter data before feeding it to training models. Another approach to the issue of machine learning security is data encryption. 
<h2>Data Security using encryption </h2>
<p>The theft of highly sensitive data is one of the reasons some countries enact strict data policies. One method of securing data to precent threat is by encrypting data. Encryption is the process of encoding information. Encrypting data can and should be enacted throughout the data analysis process from gathering, collecting, labelling, to model build, model train, model evaluation, and model deployment. Users and take measures to secure their personal data. Consumer data is often to referred to as the new currency because of how much one can learn from them. For instance, location data on a service members smart phone can be used to determine how often service members go to a training location. Data security is a serous emerging issue in the data analytics industry that should be shed more light on. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<P>Three main trends prominent in the field of data analytics are the use of machine learning, data democratization, and introduction of new data analytics methodology- data fabric. These trends will continue to have a lasting impact on the industry for years to come. Advancements in data technology also gave rise to threats in the industry. Data theft and exploitation are two of the most common emerging issue in the data analytics industry. </p>
